unittest liberary => it is available in python build with automated error runner.

django test.py setup function will tell django for setup related to test. in short define the dummy data for testing

assertTrue
assertFalse
assertEqual

python manage.py test  => it just going to run the test file

python -m pip install -U selenium => installing package on windows.

unittest methods

assertEqual
assertNotEqual
assertIn
assertNotIn

*******************
CI/CD => Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery

How the code integrated across multiple teams and deliver to users

*CI
Frequent merges to main branch
Automated unit testing

CD
Short release schdules

what tools allowed for ease help CI and CD
1.GitHub Actions => someone to push to repository i want to make some actions automatically checked 
Test our code anytime any one pushes to the code
