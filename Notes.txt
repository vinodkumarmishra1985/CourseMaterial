int
float
str
True/False
None => absence of varaible

input => takes the input from user.
It always gives you string.

+ => add 2 numbers
+ => combine/concatenate 2 strings

In python Indentation is required 
because it knows which statement is inside or outside of the condition

elif => shortcut for elseif in pyton

**Imp
TypeError => means python is not accepting 1 format the value with different
NameError => means file/function is not defined

#powerful feature


sequenence => like array

sequence of any type of data can be stored in list in python

tupple => value if going to change. 
e.g. Graphing in 2 dimension to represent the value x and y

Data structures.

list => sequence. It is denoted by []. It is muttable. append to last and remove are functions
tuple -> sequence of immuatable values. It is denoated by ()
set - collection of uniq values. No particular order. Every value appears exact ones . s = set() #emmpty set
dict -> collection of key-value pairs. Physical dictionariy of work and defination.

e.g of dict
houses={"Harry":"Gryffindor", "Vinod":"NC"}

print (houses["Harry"])


****************
function keyword is def like define

*****import files from other functions
import command
import functions

for i in range(10):
    print (f"The square of {i} is {functions.square(i)}")



**********************************
object oriented programming

object -> stored the data and perform and oprate actions on these objects

class is type of template for object

def__init__ => automatically called when it try to create a class object

it takes multiple of parameter
1. self => references the object we are currently dealing with
2. and other names input parameter


*****
decortors => is a function and return a modified functions

a function can be passed as input to other function and get an output from a function.

It is very powerful functions.
