javascript framework: 

React is a javascript libarary is enable to design the page based on some underlying state.
It is declarative programming. 

Imperative programming => tell the computer what to do. update teh counter from 1 to 10 => 
view <h1>0</h1>
logic: let num = parseInt(document.querySelctor('h1').innerHTML;
num += 1;
document.querySelctor('h1').innerHTML = num;

Declartive programming => describe what is is going to be value
view : <h1>{num}</h1>
Logic: num +=1 # since we have declared the value of num in h1 tag, reactive will effectively the value of num

It helps to divide the application into component based on some underlying steps/varialbes.
React will handle the process for us.

Include these 3 javascript pages
1. React2
2. ReactDom (take the react component and insert into DOM)
3. Babel (package in order to trasnalate code from 1 lang to another. We dont write javascriptt we write extenstion jsx)
babel is convert jsx code to javascript for browser to understand.

every react is designed into classes.

this.prpos.<varialbes> => will give react varialbe name
